Learning how to code was not an easy process, but it was definitely a fun experience. <br>
To summarize my journey for the first quarter, I would like to share a few scenarios of <br>
my experience through the ups and downs of coding. 
<br>
<br>
On the first day of school, I was a bit hesitant and doubtful of my coding skills, and I <br>
worried that I might not be able to catch up to the lessons because I am quite new to the <br>
concept of coding. But as time went on, I learned to adapt and gave coding a chance. <br>
Though it wasn't easy for me, I still had fun, and I'm glad that I learned more about coding, <br>
thanks to Ms. Uminga! Not only did I learn how to code, but I also learned to bond with my classmates <br>
and friends while coding because of the pairworks and groupworks that Ms. Uminga gave us throughout <br>
the whole quarter.
