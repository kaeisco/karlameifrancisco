Learning how to code was not an easy process, but it was definitely a fun experience. To summarize my journey for the first quarter, I would like to share a few scenarios of my experience through the ups and downs of coding. On the first day of school, I was a bit hesitant and doubtful of my coding skills, and I worried that I might not be able to catch up to the lessons because I am quite new to the concept of coding. But as time went on, I learned to adapt and gave coding a chance. Though it wasn't easy for me, I still had fun, and I'm glad that I learned more about coding, thanks to Ms. Uminga!
